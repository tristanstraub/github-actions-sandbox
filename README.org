This project demonstrates github actions, specifically for running clojure test runners.

The workflow and action can be found under the .github directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC
.github
├── actions
│   └── test
│       ├── action.yml
│       ├── Dockerfile
│       ├── entrypoint.sh
│       └── Makefile
└── workflows
    └── test.yml
#+END_SRC

* Testing locally

Under .github/actions/test, the Makefile tests the docker container locally.
Run "make" from within that directory.
